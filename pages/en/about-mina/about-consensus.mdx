# Consensus
Learn about Mina's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ouroboros Samisika

Mina builds on Ouroboros to create Ouroboros Samisika, a provably secure PoS protocol that combines the best features of each iteration of Ouroboros to deliver a PoS mechanism that can resolve long-range forks without requiring history or risking centralization by relying on trusted third parties to provide fork information.
