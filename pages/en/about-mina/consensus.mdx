# Consensus
Learn about Mina's proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, Ouroboros Samisika

Mina Protocol uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism called **Ouroboros Samasika**.

Based on Cardano’s PoS Ouroboros, Ouroboros Samisika is a secure PoS protocol that can resolve long-range forks without requiring history. It is the first succinct proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that achieves strong decentralization properties by not relying on trusted third parties to provide fork information.
